The importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable in javaScript is:-
(1)-Clear and meaningful variable names make your code more readable and understandable. 
(2)-When someone, including yourself, reads the code later on, descriptive variable names make it easier to comprehend the purpose and intent of the variable.
(3)- More readable.

eg:- let firstName= "amit";
Let lastName = "kumar";

in this example it is clearly understandable that the first Name is amit and the last Name is kumar.
