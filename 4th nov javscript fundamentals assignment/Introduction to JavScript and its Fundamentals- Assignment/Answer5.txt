JavaScript Comments:-
JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

There are two types or ways of commenting in JavaScript:-

(1)- Single line Comments:- Single line comments start wit // .
Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript.

(1)- Multi-line comments:- Multi-line comments start with /* and end with  */.
Any text between /* and */ will be ignoredby the JavaScript.

eg:- 
/* This is a multi - line comment
This code will be ignored for multiple line 
until it find the 
end point.
