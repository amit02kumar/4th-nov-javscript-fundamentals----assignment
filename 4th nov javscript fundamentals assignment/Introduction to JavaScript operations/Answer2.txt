Types of Operators in javaScript:-
(a)-Arithmetic Operators
(b)-Assignment Operators
(c)-Comparison Operators
(d)-String Operators
(e)-Logical Operators
(f)-Bitwise Operators
(g)-Ternary Operators
(h)-Typeof Operators

[a]- Arithmetic Operators:- Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:
eg:- let a=5;
     let b=4;
     let sum = a+b;

[b]-Assignment Operators:-Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.
eg:- let x = 10;
     x += 5;

[c]-Comparison operators:-Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.
eg:- if(age <= 18){
    console.log("Not eligible to vote");
}

[4]- String operators:- All the comparison operators above can also be used on strings:
eg:- All the comparison operators above can also be used on strings:
eg:- let text1 = "A";
     let text2 = "B";
     let result = text1 <text2;

[5]-Logical operator:- Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
eg:- if(a>=8 || b<=5){
    console.log("This is a logical operator");
}
     
[6]-Bitwise operator:-Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers.
Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.

[7]-Ternary operator:-JavaScript also contains a conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition.
eg:- let voteable= (age <18)? "Not eligible":"eligible";

[8]-Typeof operator:- we can use the typeof operator to find the data type of a JavaScript variable.
eg:- typeof "Amit";
